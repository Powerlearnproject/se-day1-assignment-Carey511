# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles involving design,development and testing of software products
The importance of software development is to help solve the worlds problems that may communications,commerce and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages eg chatgpt
Development of software engineering as a discipline
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a)Requirements- this involves the gatheringand documenting of user needs
b) Design- this helps in the creating of high level and detailed designs
c)Implementation - this is represented by writing of code and building of software
d) Testing - This is basically testing to ensure it meets quality
e)Deployment- this is when the software is released to users
f) maintenance - this is when ongoing support is provided


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodoligies provise a sequestial approach with distinct phases which flows downwards like a waterfall while agile methodologies focuses on interactive and incremental approach eg a mental health app that is Ai driven which is flexible and easy to use


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Devolper - responsible for coding and designing 
Quality Assuarnce Engineer - ensuress that the code meets quality
Project Manager - manages all the projects and oversees that all projects are intact

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive writing tools eg.visual studio while VCS is a control system that tracks changes and work coordination for example git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines - have pressure to deliver and hence are rushed  this could be solved by reassesment of the timelines
Changing requirements - this could include the development cycle and hence it would be necessary to use agile methodologies
Technical debt could be overcomed by effective communication


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is for individual components
Intergration testing is for between components 
System testing is for the system as whole 
Acceptance testing is fortesting software against user requirements to ensure it meets the users needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Enginering is the crafting of clear, specific and concise questions to get the best responses from AI models.it helps improve interaction between humans and AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example; vague  Give the importance of gases .
Clear ; explain to me the importance of oxygen and nitrogen to plants this facilitates for clarity and effectiveness.
